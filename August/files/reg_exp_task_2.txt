A decimal numeral, or just decimal, or casually decimal number, refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a decimal separator (for example the "." in -10.00 (-10) or 3.14159 ). "Decimal" may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in "3.14 is the approximation of Ï€ to two decimals". 1/100
